# Perspectives-on-a-Sustainable-Future-through-NLP

This project focuses on analyzing YouTube comments from TED Talks related to sustainability. By utilizing public discussions, we aim to gain insights into how sustainability is framed and perceived within public discourse. Recognizing the significant influence these conversations can have on awareness, policy, and individual actions towards sustainable living, we employ advanced text analysis techniques to offer a comprehensive snapshot of the current sustainability dialogue.
